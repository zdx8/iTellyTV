 * The per-row state that survives a playlist refresh.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes `is_favorite` and `last_played_at`: those are
 * the user's data, not the provider's, and a refresh must never touch
 * them. They are preserved implicitly because the merge keeps the row's
 * primary key and only rewrites the provider-supplied columns.
 *
 * Public only because [ChannelDao] is a public interface and Room
 * projections cannot be narrowed to `internal`. Treat it as an
 * implementation detail of the merge — nothing outside
 * `data.source` should reference it.

/**
 * Computes how to reconcile an already-stored playlist against a freshly
 * parsed one, *in place*, rather than dropping the table and rebuilding
 * it.
 *
 * Why this exists: the previous `DELETE`-then-`INSERT` approach gave every
 * channel a brand-new auto-increment id on every refresh. Because
 * `is_favorite` and `last_played_at` live on the channel row, and
 * `recent_plays` has a cascading foreign key to it, each refresh
 * silently wiped the user's favorites and their recent-play history.
 * Refreshes happen on every cold start, so a favorite could not survive a
 * single app restart.
 *
 * Channels are matched by URL, which is what identifies a stream in an
 * M3U source. The merge is:
 *
 *   - same URL, provider metadata unchanged  → left completely alone
 *   - same URL, provider metadata changed    → `UPDATE` the metadata only
 *   - URL not present before                 → `INSERT`
 *   - stored URL no longer in the source     → `DELETE`
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so it can be unit-tested on the plain JVM —
 * Room DAOs need an instrumented database, and this is the part with the
 * actual logic.
