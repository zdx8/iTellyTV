/**
 * ChannelDrawer — the left-side overlay that lets a TV viewer
 * browse channels while a stream is playing in the background.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - 30% width drawer sliding over the video (left side).
 *   - Default state: HIDDEN. Auto-shows on D-pad LEFT, hides on
 *     BACK, or auto-hides after [AUTO_HIDE_MS] of no key input.
 *   - UP/DOWN navigate the list. Selecting a row invokes
 *     [onChannelSelected] so the caller can switch playback.
 *   - ENTER (or any "show" key) also counts as activity → resets
 *     the auto-hide timer.
 *
 * The drawer is a pure helper; it owns no player state. The
 * activity manages "current channel index" and forwards the
 * drawer events through [Callbacks].
