/**
 * D-pad channel-index arithmetic, extracted from [ChannelDrawer].
 *
 * ChannelDrawer itself needs a real `View` tree (an inflated ListView,
 * a Handler on the main looper), so its navigation logic cannot run on
 * a plain JVM. Pulling the arithmetic out into this dependency-free
 * object means the behaviour that actually broke before — off-by-one
 * at the ends of the list, and getting permanently stuck on the last
 * channel while auto-advancing past dead streams — is covered by fast
 * unit tests.
 *
 * Both functions return a valid index, or `-1` when [size] is not
 * positive (an empty channel list has nowhere to move to).
